# Pre-Landing PR Review

You are running the `/review` workflow. Analyze the current branch's diff against main for structural issues that tests don't catch.

## Arguments

- `/review` — full review of current branch vs main (default)
- `/review greptile` — include Greptile bot comment triage
- `/review pr <number>` — review an existing PR by number (fetches diff from GitHub)

---

## Step 1: Pre-flight

**If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `pr <number>`:** PR review mode.
1. Run `gh pr view <number> --json state,isDraft` to check eligibility.
2. If the PR is closed, a draft, or trivially small (automated/bot PR), output: **"PR not eligible for review."** and stop.
3. Run `gh pr diff <number>` to get the diff. Use this instead of `git diff origin/main` for all subsequent steps.
4. Skip to Step 2.

**Otherwise:** Local branch review mode.
1. Run `git branch --show-current` to get the current branch.
2. If on `main`, output: **"Nothing to review — you're on main."** and stop.
3. Run `git fetch origin main --quiet && git diff origin/main --stat` to check if there's a diff.
4. If no diff, output: **"No changes against main. Nothing to review."** and stop.

---

## Step 2: Load Review Checklist

Read `.claude/skills/review/checklist.md`.

**If the file cannot be read, STOP and report:** "Review checklist not found. Run /configure-claude to install."

---

## Step 2.5: Greptile Comment Triage (conditional)

Only run this step if:
- `$ARGUMENTS` contains "greptile", OR
- A file exists at `$HOME/.claude/review/projects/$REMOTE_SLUG/greptile-history.md` for this repo
  (derive `REMOTE_SLUG` from `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner' | tr '/' '__'`)

Read `.claude/skills/review/greptile-triage.md` and follow the fetch, filter, classify, and escalation detection steps.

**If no PR exists, `gh` fails, API returns an error, or there are zero Greptile comments:** Skip this step silently. Greptile integration is additive — the review works without it.

**If Greptile comments are found:** Store the classifications (VALID & ACTIONABLE, VALID BUT ALREADY FIXED, FALSE POSITIVE, SUPPRESSED) — you will need them in Step 5.

---

## Step 3: Dispatch Parallel Review Agents

Dispatch **up to 7 parallel agents** in a single message using the Agent tool. Agents F and G are conditional — only dispatch them if the diff contains relevant code.

**Agent A — Convention review (@code-reviewer):**
```text
prompt: "You are the @code-reviewer agent. Review the diff between origin/main and HEAD.

Follow the full code-reviewer workflow:
1. Run: git diff origin/main, git diff origin/main --name-only
2. Read all CLAUDE.md files in the repo
3. If .claude/specs/ exists, detect active spec from branch name
4. For each changed file, read 1-2 sibling files for pattern context
5. Run the review checklist: convention compliance, secrets, debug artifacts,
   dead code, error handling, spec alignment, pattern consistency, security

Produce your standard findings list with file:line references and severity
(critical/warning/info). Do NOT write any review stamp file.
Return findings only."
description: "Convention review (@code-reviewer)"
```

**Agent B — Checklist review (security + structural):**
```text
prompt: "Run a pre-landing code review on the diff between origin/main and HEAD.
Run `git diff origin/main` to get the full diff. Read the checklist at
.claude/skills/review/checklist.md. Apply the two-pass review:

Pass 1 (CRITICAL): SQL & Data Safety, Race Conditions & Concurrency,
LLM Output Trust Boundary, Auth & Security Boundaries.
Pass 2 (INFORMATIONAL): All remaining categories.

Respect the Suppressions section — do NOT flag items listed there.
Read the FULL diff before flagging anything.

Output format: 'Checklist Review: N issues (X critical, Y informational)'
followed by findings with file:line references and suggested fixes.
Categorize each as CRITICAL or INFORMATIONAL."
description: "Checklist review (security + structural)"
```

**Agent C — Git blame & history review:**
```text
prompt: "Review the changes between origin/main and HEAD using git history context.

1. Run `git diff origin/main --name-only` to get changed files.
2. For each changed file, run `git log --oneline -10 -- <file>` and
   `git blame -L <changed-lines> -- <file>` to understand the history.
3. Look for:
   - Code that was recently refactored and is being changed again (churn = risk)
   - Patterns that were deliberately established by previous commits
   - Bug fixes being undone or weakened by the current changes
   - TODO/FIXME/HACK comments in blamed lines that are relevant

Return a list of findings with file:line references. For each, include the
relevant git history context (commit hash + message) that makes it a concern.
Only flag issues where history provides insight — skip if history is clean."
description: "Git blame & history review"
```

**Agent D — Previous PR comment review:**
```text
prompt: "Check if previous PRs that touched these files had review comments
that may also apply to the current changes.

1. Run `git diff origin/main --name-only` to get changed files.
2. For each file (max 5), run:
   `gh pr list --state merged --search <filename> --limit 3 --json number`
3. For each found PR, fetch review comments:
   `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<number>/comments --jq '.[] | select(.path == \"<file>\") | {body: .body, line: .line}'`
4. Check if any previous review comments apply to the current changes
   (same patterns, same concerns, same files).

Return findings only if previous comments are genuinely relevant to the
current diff. Skip stale or inapplicable comments."
description: "Previous PR comment review"
```

**Agent E — Code comment compliance:**
```text
prompt: "Check that the changes between origin/main and HEAD comply with
code comments in the modified files.

1. Run `git diff origin/main --name-only` to get changed files.
2. For each changed file, read the full file and identify:
   - TODO/FIXME/HACK comments near changed lines
   - Docstrings or inline comments that describe expected behavior
   - Warning comments (e.g., 'DO NOT MODIFY', 'must be called before X')
3. Verify the changes don't violate any of these documented constraints.

Return findings with file:line references. Only flag genuine violations —
not stale comments about unrelated code."
description: "Code comment compliance"
```

**Agent F — Silent failure hunter (conditional):**

Only dispatch if the diff contains error-handling code (try/catch, .catch, error callbacks, Result types, fallback logic).

```text
prompt: "Hunt for silent failures in the target diff for this review.

Use the same diff source selected in Step 1:
- local mode: `git diff origin/main`
- PR mode: the `gh pr diff <number>` output already fetched
For every error-handling
location in the changed code, scrutinize:

1. **Catch block specificity:** Does it catch only expected errors, or could
   it accidentally suppress unrelated errors? List every unexpected error type
   that could be hidden.
2. **Logging quality:** Is the error logged with enough context to debug
   6 months from now? Does it include what operation failed and relevant IDs?
3. **User feedback:** Does the user receive actionable feedback, or does the
   error vanish silently?
4. **Fallback behavior:** Is fallback logic explicitly justified, or does it
   mask the underlying problem? Would the user be confused by fallback behavior?
5. **Error propagation:** Should this error bubble up instead of being caught here?

Flag these patterns as CRITICAL:
- Empty catch blocks
- Catch blocks that only log and continue without user feedback
- Returning null/undefined/default on error without logging
- Broad exception catching that hides unrelated errors
- Retry logic that exhausts attempts without informing the user

Return findings with file:line, severity (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM),
issue description, hidden error types, and recommended fix."
description: "Silent failure hunter"
```

**Agent G — Type design review (conditional):**

Only dispatch if the diff introduces or significantly modifies type definitions (types, interfaces, enums, classes, structs in TypeScript/Python/Go/Rust).

```text
prompt: "Review type design in the target diff for this review.

Use the same diff source selected in Step 1:
- local mode: `git diff origin/main`
- PR mode: the `gh pr diff <number>` output already fetched
Find new or modified type definitions
(interfaces, types, enums, classes, structs).

For each new or significantly modified type, evaluate:

1. **Invariant expression:** Are constraints obvious from the type definition?
   Can illegal states be represented? Rate 1-10.
2. **Encapsulation:** Are internals properly hidden? Can invariants be
   violated from outside? Rate 1-10.
3. **Enforcement:** Are invariants checked at construction? Are all mutation
   points guarded? Rate 1-10.
4. **Usefulness:** Do the invariants prevent real bugs? Are they aligned
   with business requirements? Rate 1-10.

Flag these anti-patterns:
- Anemic types with no behavior or validation
- Types exposing mutable internals
- Invariants enforced only through documentation/comments
- Missing validation at construction boundaries
- Types that rely on external code to maintain invariants

Return findings with file:line, the type name, ratings, and specific
improvement suggestions. Keep suggestions pragmatic — don't overcomplicate."
description: "Type design review"
```

Wait for all agents to return.

---

## Step 4: Merge, Score, and Filter Findings

1. Collect findings from all agents (5-7 depending on which conditional agents ran).
2. Deduplicate: if multiple agents flag the same file:line for the same issue, keep the one with most detail.
3. **Confidence score each finding** on a 0-100 scale:
   - **0-25:** Likely false positive — doesn't stand up to scrutiny, or is a pre-existing issue.
   - **25-50:** Might be real but unverifiable, or is a stylistic preference not backed by CLAUDE.md.
   - **50-75:** Real issue but minor — nitpick, rarely hit in practice, or low impact.
   - **75-100:** Verified real issue — will impact functionality, directly violates CLAUDE.md, or has historical evidence (git blame/previous PR comments support it).
4. **Filter out findings scoring below 60.** This eliminates noise and false positives.
5. Classify remaining findings: score ≥ 80 = CRITICAL, score 60-79 = INFORMATIONAL.
6. If Greptile triage ran in Step 2.5, append VALID & ACTIONABLE Greptile findings as CRITICAL items.

---

## Step 5: Present Findings

Output all findings:

```text
## Pre-Landing Review: N issues (X critical, Y informational)
[+ M Greptile comments (A valid, B fixed, C FP)]  ← only if Greptile ran

### CRITICAL (blocking) — confidence ≥ 80
1. [file:line] Problem description (score: 85)
   Fix: suggested fix
   Source: convention | checklist | blame | prev-PR | comments | silent-failure | type-design | greptile

### INFORMATIONAL (advisory) — confidence 60-79
1. [file:line] Problem description (score: 65)
   Fix: suggested fix
```

**For each CRITICAL finding**, use AskUserQuestion individually (one issue per call, not batched):
- A) Fix it now (recommended)
- B) Acknowledge and ship anyway
- C) False positive — skip

Lead with your recommendation and explain WHY.

**If user chose A (fix):** Describe the exact fix needed. Do NOT apply it — the skill is read-only. Tell the user to apply the fix and re-run `/review`.

### Greptile Comment Resolution

After presenting your own findings, if Greptile comments were classified in Step 2.5:

1. **VALID & ACTIONABLE:** Already included in CRITICAL findings above — follows the same AskUserQuestion flow.

2. **FALSE POSITIVE:** Present each via AskUserQuestion:
   - Show the comment: file:line + body summary + permalink URL
   - Explain why it's a false positive
   - Options: A) Reply to Greptile explaining why incorrect (recommended), B) Fix it anyway, C) Ignore
   - If user chose A, reply using the False Positive template from greptile-triage.md

3. **VALID BUT ALREADY FIXED:** Reply using the Already Fixed template — no AskUserQuestion needed.

4. **SUPPRESSED:** Skip silently.

Write triage outcomes to history files as documented in greptile-triage.md.

---

## Step 5.5: Flow Diagram

Generate a **Mermaid diagram** showing the key flow introduced or changed in this diff. Pick the diagram type that fits best:

- `sequenceDiagram` — for request/response flows, multi-step pipelines, hook execution chains
- `flowchart TD` — for decision trees, state machines, before/after architecture comparisons
- `stateDiagram-v2` — for entity lifecycle or state transitions

**Rules:**
- Read the full diff first. Only diagram **new/changed flows**, not the entire system.
- 5-15 nodes max. If the PR is small (< 50 lines, config-only, docs-only), skip this step.
- Include error paths where the diff introduces error handling.

**If a PR exists** (check with `gh pr view --json number --jq '.number'`):
Post the diagram as a PR comment using `gh`:

```bash
gh pr comment <number> --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Flow Diagram

```mermaid
<diagram>
```

_Auto-generated by `/review`_
EOF
)"
```

**If no PR exists** (reviewing before push): Include the diagram in the Step 5 output instead.

---

## Step 5.6: TODO Cross-Reference

Check for `TODO.md` or `TODOS.md` in the repository root. If found:

- Does this PR close any open TODOs? Note: "This PR addresses TODO: <title>"
- Does this PR introduce work that should become a TODO? Flag as informational.
- Are there related TODOs that provide context? Reference them alongside related findings.

If no TODO file exists, skip silently.

---

## Step 6: Write Review Stamp

**If no unresolved CRITICAL findings** (all resolved as B/C, or none existed):

Compute the diff hash and write the review stamp:

```bash
node -e "
  const crypto = require('crypto');
  const { execSync } = require('child_process');
  const fs = require('fs');
  const path = require('path');
  const diff = execSync('git diff --cached', { encoding: 'utf8' });
  const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(diff).digest('hex');
  const reviewDir = path.join(process.cwd(), '.claude');
  if (!fs.existsSync(reviewDir)) fs.mkdirSync(reviewDir, { recursive: true });
  fs.writeFileSync(path.join(reviewDir, '.last-review'), JSON.stringify({
    diffHash: hash,
    reviewedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
    reviewer: '/review'
  }) + '\n');
  console.log('Review stamp written: ' + hash.slice(0, 12) + '...');
"
```

**If any CRITICAL finding was resolved with "Fix it now":** Do NOT write the stamp. The user needs to apply fixes and re-run `/review`.

---

## Step 7: Summary

```text
Review complete: PASS | N informational notes
```
or
```text
Review complete: BLOCKED | N critical issues need resolution
```

---

## Important Rules

- **Read the FULL diff before commenting.** Do not flag issues already addressed in the diff.
- **Read-only by default.** Only write the review stamp file. Never modify code, commit, push, or create PRs.
- **Be terse.** One line problem, one line fix. No preamble.
- **Only flag real problems.** Skip anything that's fine. Respect the suppressions list.
- **One issue per AskUserQuestion.** Never batch multiple issues into one question.

## Gotchas

- **REMOTE_SLUG uses `tr '/' '__'`** to preserve the owner in the path (e.g., `owner__repo`). Don't use just the repo name.
- **Greptile auto-detect is repo-scoped, not wildcard.** The history file path includes the full `REMOTE_SLUG`, so it only activates for repos that have been triaged before.
- **The review stamp hashes `git diff --cached`** (staged changes only). If you stage/unstage files after the stamp, the review gate will see a mismatch. Stage everything before running `/review`.
- **If the checklist file is missing**, the skill stops early. Run `/configure-claude` to install it.
- **Flow diagram is posted as a PR comment**, not in the review output. If no PR exists yet, include it inline instead. Skip for trivial diffs (< 50 lines, config-only, docs-only).
- **Confidence scoring filters noise.** Findings below 60 are dropped entirely. Don't lower the threshold to include more — the cutoff exists to prevent false positive fatigue.
- **Git blame agent may be slow on large files.** It runs `git blame` per changed file — on files with thousands of lines, this takes time. The 5 agents run in parallel so it doesn't block the others.
- **PR mode (`/review pr <number>`)** fetches the diff from GitHub, not the local branch. The review stamp is NOT written in PR mode (there's no local staged diff to hash).
